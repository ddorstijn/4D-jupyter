    "More than three spacial dimensions is something humans cannot inherently understand, as we are merely three dimensional beings. Still it is a fun excersize to try to understand more about these arbitrary dimensions. A good way of visualizing higher dimensions is by projecting it down. This is a technique already used in 3D visualisation. A virtual camera projects the 3D information onto a 2D plane that is then send to the screen of your computer or tv. We can also use this for projecting higher dimensions into 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper we will look at an implamentation of this projection in higher dimensions. Before we start we first need to import a few libraries. Numpy for matrices calculation, a couple of functions from math and our self-written vector class that handles vector data for any dimensional vector. This class provides basic functionality for linear vector calculation. "

    "We use simplexes for our visualisation. Simplexes can be calculated for every dimension. A simplex is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. And it has specific properties that help us calculate the vertices for this object. The rule for generating a simplex is that you need n+1 vertices.\n",

    "The coordinates of the vertices of a regular n-dimensional simplex can be obtained from these two properties:\n",

    "These can be used as follows. Let vectors (v0, v1, ..., vn) represent the vertices of an n-simplex center the origin, all unit vectors so a distance 1 from the origin, satisfying the first property. The second property means the dot product between any pair of the vectors is − 1 / n. This can be used to calculate positions for them. \n",

    "For the projection of higher dimensions into three dimension we have a seperate set of functions. Because we do the same projection as from 3d to 2d, we have to create seperate cameras for every dimension. This means we make use of the MVP matrices. MVP is short for Model, View, Projection and these matrices multiplied give the matrix that can project the vertices into a lower dimension. For this example we do not use a translation matrix. The view matrix is renamed to lookat matrix because we create the matrix from two values. The from vector of the camera and the to vector. This is a point the camera is looking at. "
